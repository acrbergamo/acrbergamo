Philosophy questions, data science decrypts.
The mind inquires, numbers reveal.

### Method:

1ยบ) Never accept anything as true unless it is evidently recognized as such.
2ยบ) Divide each difficulty into as many parts as possible to better examine each detail.
3ยบ) Conduct resolutions from the simplest, fundamental, and evident ones to the most complex, composite, and enigmatic ones.
4ยบ) Make complete enumerations and meticulous revisions everywhere to ensure nothing is omitted.
